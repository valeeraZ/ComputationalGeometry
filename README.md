<h1 align="center">Computational Geometry Algorithm</h1>


> Some implementation or introduction of some computational geometry algorithms or graph algorithms that I've learned in university. For each algorithm, I will try to give a demo visualization by `javax` in Java or by plot library in Python.

## Roadmap
* ✅ K Means: partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean
* 🔧 Dominating Set
* 🔧 Feedback Vertex Set
* 🔧 Steiner Tree
* 🔧 Page Rank
* 🔧 Community Detection: Label Propagation, Louvain
* 🔧 K Core Decomposition


## Usage

For implementation in Java:
```sh
java -jar **.jar [file]
```
For implementation in Python: See specific README in project.
